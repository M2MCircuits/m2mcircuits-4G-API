MakerModemLib compile errors and changes—mguerrero—1/23/16—
debugged in Beagle Bone, Debian environment—

cModemInterface.c
{
—  in mmCheckForConnection, removed couple of #if and #endif statements. Seemed unnecessary? where causing scope error with variables “result” and “done” in function.
}

cModemStream.c 
{
— in mmReadBytesUntil, moved initial “i” declaration outside for loop to rid C99 mode for loop declaration error; line 467. Same change in mmReadBytes line 450, mmFind line345.

Could just use C99 mode during gcc compile??, easy change… but easier to get working by default gcc settings preloaded on Debian/Beagle Bone

—In mmReadBytes. added variable type int “c” line 452
}

cSMS.c
{
lines 77, 80, missing parenthesis.

Note: cSMS, compiles with several type cast warnings, need to re-check after testing
}

cInet.c
{
— In mmSocketAvail, moved initial “i” declaration outside for loop to rid C99 mode for loop declaration error; line 88. Same changes in mmDirectLinkRead, line 203.
}
